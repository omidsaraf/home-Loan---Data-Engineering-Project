### **1. Silver Layer â€“ Transformed Tables**

These tables will be created by joining or cleansing data from the **Bronze Layer**.

---

### **1.1. Loan Applications (Cleaned and Enriched)**

The **Silver Layer** cleans up the raw loan application data, adds necessary business logic, and might join it with external data sources like CRM or risk scores.

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.silver_loan_applications (
    loan_id STRING,
    applicant_name STRING,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(18, 2),
    loan_type STRING,
    region STRING,
    application_date DATE,
    disbursement_date DATE,
    credit_score INT,
    employment_status STRING,
    application_status STRING,
    ingestion_date TIMESTAMP,
    enriched_date TIMESTAMP
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/loan_applications';
```

---

### **1.2. Loan Disbursement Table (Cleansed and Enriched)**

This table integrates information from the **Bronze Layer** and any other relevant data sources (e.g., risk models or external APIs) to cleanse the disbursement data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.silver_loan_disbursements (
    disbursement_id STRING,
    loan_id STRING,
    disbursement_amount DECIMAL(18, 2),
    disbursement_date DATE,
    region STRING,
    disbursement_status STRING,
    processing_date TIMESTAMP,
    enriched_date TIMESTAMP
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/loan_disbursements';
```

---

### **1.3. Customer Profile Table (Cleaned)**

This is an enriched version of the customer profile, potentially joining data from various sources like CRM, core banking systems, or external data sources (e.g., credit score).

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.silver_customer_profiles (
    customer_id STRING,
    customer_name STRING,
    email STRING,
    phone STRING,
    region STRING,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    credit_score INT,
    annual_income DECIMAL(18, 2),
    employment_status STRING,
    address STRING,
    registration_date TIMESTAMP,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/customer_profiles';
```

---

### **1.4. Loan Default Risk Model (Cleansed)**

This table will be enriched with risk model outputs, such as probability of loan default, customer behavior patterns, etc.

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.silver_loan_default_risk (
    loan_id STRING,
    customer_id STRING,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(18, 2),
    risk_score INT,
    predicted_default_probability DECIMAL(5, 4),
    model_version STRING,
    evaluation_date TIMESTAMP,
    enriched_date TIMESTAMP
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/loan_default_risk';
```

---

### **1.5. Loan Repayment Table (Cleansed)**

This table contains cleaned loan repayment data. It tracks the repayment progress of loans and links to the customer profiles.

```sql
CREATE TABLE silver.silver_loan_repayments (
    repayment_id STRING,
    loan_id STRING,
    repayment_amount DECIMAL(18, 2),
    repayment_date DATE,
    outstanding_balance DECIMAL(18, 2),
    repayment_status STRING,
    processing_date TIMESTAMP,
    enriched_date TIMESTAMP
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/mnt/silver/loan_repayments';
```
