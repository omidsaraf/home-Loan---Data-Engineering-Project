1. **Streaming Data**:

   * The **streaming data** will be continuously processed in micro-batches (using Spark Structured Streaming).
   * You can use **`foreachBatch()`** to process each micro-batch and then store or join the results with batch data in the **Silver Layer**.

2. **Batch Data**:

   * The **batch data** will be periodically processed (e.g., hourly, daily) and stored in the **Bronze Layer** first, then **transformed** into the **Silver Layer**.

3. **Join Logic**:

   * In the **Silver Layer**, the **streaming data** can be joined with **batch data** using standard SQL join operations or PySpark transformations (e.g., using `join()`, `merge()` in Delta Lake).

### Example: Joining Streaming and Batch Data in Silver Layer

**1. Stream (Kafka) and Batch Data:**
Letâ€™s say you have **streaming loan application data** from Kafka and **batch loan disbursement data** stored in ADLS. You want to join these two datasets to produce a clean, enriched set of data in the **Silver Layer**.

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql.streaming import DataStreamWriter

# Streaming data (from Kafka)
streaming_df = spark.readStream.format("kafka").option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "<kafka_broker>").option("subscribe", "<topic>").load()

# Batch data (from Silver)
batch_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/silver/loan_disbursements")

# Cleansing and transformation of streaming data
streaming_transformed_df = streaming_df.selectExpr("CAST(key AS STRING) as loan_id", "CAST(value AS STRING) as loan_details")
streaming_transformed_df = streaming_transformed_df.withColumn("timestamp", F.current_timestamp())

# Join streaming and batch data in Silver layer
joined_df = streaming_transformed_df.join(batch_df, on="loan_id", how="inner")

# Output the results to Delta Lake in Silver layer
joined_df.writeStream.format("delta").outputMode("append").option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/silver/checkpoints/loan_application_disbursement").start("/mnt/silver/loan_application_disbursement")
```

### SQL Example for Joining Streaming and Batch Data in Silver Layer:

**1. Batch (Loan Applications) and Streaming (Loan Repayments)**:

Assume that **loan applications** are being processed in batch, and **loan repayments** are processed in real-time via streaming.

```sql
-- Load batch data (Loan Applications)
WITH loan_applications AS (
    SELECT loan_id, applicant_name, loan_amount, application_date
    FROM bronze.bronze_loan_applications
),
-- Load streaming data (Loan Repayments)
loan_repayments AS (
    SELECT loan_id, repayment_amount, repayment_date
    FROM silver.silver_loan_repayments
    WHERE repayment_date > (SELECT MAX(repayment_date) FROM bronze.bronze_loan_repayments)
)
-- Join the batch and streaming data
SELECT la.loan_id, la.applicant_name, la.loan_amount, lr.repayment_amount, lr.repayment_date
FROM loan_applications la
JOIN loan_repayments lr ON la.loan_id = lr.loan_id;
```

In this example:

* We **join** the **batch loan application data** with **streaming loan repayment data**.
* **Stream** data is filtered by the latest **repayment\_date**, ensuring that we only get **new data** from the stream.

This transformation in the **Silver Layer** ensures that both data sources are aligned and enriched before being used for reporting or analytics.

### **Summary of Best Practices for Joining Stream and Batch Data:**

* **Silver Layer** is where **streaming** and **batch data** should be joined.
* Stream data is ingested continuously in **micro-batches** (using tools like **Spark Structured Streaming**).
* Use **SQL-based** joins or **PySpark joins** to combine both datasets.
* Handle **late-arriving data** and **out-of-order** data in the **Silver Layer** using **watermarking** and **windowing** techniques.
* The **Silver Layer** provides the cleansed, enriched, and joined data that is ready for reporting, analytics, or machine learning.
