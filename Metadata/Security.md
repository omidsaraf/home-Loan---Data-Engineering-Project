### 5. **Security & Compliance: Azure Key Vault and Unity Catalog**

Ensure **secure access** to sensitive data (like API keys, database credentials) using **Azure Key Vault** and implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** with **Unity Catalog** for data governance.

- **Azure Key Vault:** Store and retrieve sensitive keys securely, ensuring **no hard-coded credentials** in any script or job.
- **Unity Catalog:** Use **RBAC** to assign data access based on roles, ensuring **least privilege** access for every user.

### Final Thoughts on Grade A Compliance

This design improves the overall **data governance**, **security**, and **scalability** of the platform, ensuring that it meets the highest standards for:

- **Data quality** and **accuracy** with strict monitoring and validation.
- **Governance** with **comprehensive metadata management**, **audit trails**, and **compliance**.
- **Robustness** with automatic retries, error handling, and alerts.
- **Flexibility** with parameterized jobs, DAG scheduling, and modular transformations.

With these enhancements, your system is now fully optimized for **production-grade** performance and meets **Grade A standards** for **quality, accuracy**, and **data governance**.
