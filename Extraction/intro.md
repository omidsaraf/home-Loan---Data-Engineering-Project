## 📊 `Dashboard` – BI-Optimized SQL Views

* Houses modular, well-documented SQL views tailored for **Tableau direct querying**.
* Views follow **best practices**:

  * Use of aggregate tables and materialized views where applicable for speed.
  * Pre-calculated KPIs, rolling aggregates, and filtered partitions.
  * Clear naming conventions (`tbl_` prefix).
  * Built with **parameterized logic** where possible for flexibility.
* Maintains **data governance** by adhering to Unity Catalog permissions and masking sensitive fields.
* Enables analysts to create responsive and accurate dashboards without heavy transformation logic.

---

## 🚀 `application_apis/` – Data Serving APIs

* Contains Python-based extraction logic powering RESTful APIs for:

  * Salesforce integrations
  * Internal banking applications
  * Reporting portals
* Implements:

  * **Authentication & authorization** via OAuth2 or Azure AD tokens
  * **Pagination, filtering, and sorting** on large datasets
  * **Caching strategies** to reduce latency
  * Error handling and logging with observability integrations
* Ensures **data security** with PII masking and role-based access controls (RBAC) integrated with Unity Catalog and Azure Key Vault.

## 🛠️ Development Best Practices

| Practice                 | Description                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Modular SQL & API Design | Small, reusable components and functions        |
| Documentation            | Inline code docs and README.md for APIs & views |
| Version Control          | Use Git with branching and pull requests        |
| Testing                  | Unit and integration tests for API endpoints    |
| Performance Optimization | Indexing, query tuning, and API caching         |
| Security & Compliance    | Encrypt sensitive data, audit API usage         |

## 🔗 Integration Points

* Tableau connects directly to **Gold-layer views** in Delta Lake via Unity Catalog
* APIs serve data pulled from Gold-layer aggregates and entity resolution outputs
* Both pipelines are triggered and monitored via Airflow workflows and metadata orchestration
