# 🏠 HomeLoanIQ – Data Engineering Platform for Banking Intelligence

This project powers a **modular, metadata-driven platform** for **home loan product analytics**. It enables **real-time and batch data processing**, supporting critical banking KPIs like application approvals, disbursement velocity, default risk, and borrower segmentation — all within a **governed, cloud-native Azure architecture**.

## 🎯 Strategic Business Objectives

| Milestone         | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Discovery      | Identify key entities (Loans, Customers, Branches)    |
| 🛠️ Development   | Implement Bronze → Silver → Gold transformations      |
| 📊 KPI Dashboards | Enable Tableau and API dashboards for analysts        |
| 🔐 Compliance     | Ensure data lineage, masking, and regulatory controls |

### Key Goals:

* 📈 Boost loan approval rate through data-driven insights
* ⏱ Reduce TAT (Turnaround Time) across home loan lifecycle
* 🧠 Feed ML models for churn, risk, and customer scoring
* 📦 Achieve cloud-scale governance and modular deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

| Function           | Tooling/Technology                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Ingestion          | Azure Data Factory, Kafka, REST (for CRM/credit) |
| Processing Engine  | Azure Databricks (PySpark), Delta Lake           |
| Serving            | Tableau, Salesforce APIs, Excel/Power BI         |
| Orchestration      | Airflow + Metadata (job.csv, dag.csv)            |
| Containerization   | Docker, AKS, Helm                                |

## 📥 Ingestion Design

Sources:

* CRM Systems: Loan Applications (via REST API)
* Core Banking: Loan Book, Repayment, Defaults (via ADF)
* Credit Bureau: Risk Scores, History (via Batch CSV)
* Internal APIs: Interest Rate Policies, Mortgage Calculators

Metadata files (`job.csv`, `proc.csv`, `proc_param.csv`) drive the ingestion logic and pipeline behavior.

---

## 📐 Data Modeling Layers

### 🪵 Bronze Layer

* Raw ingestion with schema-on-read
* Partitioned Delta Lake storage
* Minimal processing: type alignment, deduplication

### ✨ Silver Layer

* Entity relationships formed (Customer ↔ Loan ↔ Branch)
* Enriched with bureau score, geolocation, and employment data
* Cleaned and validated datasets for KPIs and ML models

### 🏅 Gold Layer

* Metric-driven views and aggregates
* Dimension tables for branch, geography, and product types
* Supports APIs and dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Salesforce)

---

## 📊 KPIs & Gold Layer Examples

### Key Metrics

| KPI                    | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ApplicationVolume      | Daily loan applications by city/branch   |
| ApprovalRate           | % of applications approved               |
| AverageProcessingTime  | TAT from application to disbursal        |
| DefaultRate            | Defaults within 90 days post-disbursal   |
| LoanToValueRatio       | Loan sanctioned vs property value        |
| InterestSpread         | Net interest yield by loan type          |
| BranchPerformanceScore | Composite KPI for RM and Ops performance |

> All gold KPIs follow modular SQL templates with metadata-driven parameters.

## 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment

* Notebook validation + parameter injection (Dev → Prod)
* ADF ARM template promotion
* Airflow DAG sync and scheduling
* Cluster provisioning via Terraform or REST APIs

---

## ✅ Testing & Quality Assurance

| Test Type         | Tools                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Data Contract     | PySpark schema + Great Expectations |
| Transformation QA | Unit tests, snapshot diffs          |
| KPI Validation    | Threshold alerts via Prometheus     |
| Lineage Testing   | Unity Catalog metadata checks       |

---

## 📦 Containerization & Kubernetes

* AKS pods for real-time stream ingestion (Kafka, REST)
* Spark Streaming jobs containerized via Docker
* Helm charts define deployment and autoscaling rules

---

## 🔐 Security & Governance

* Azure Key Vault for secret management
* Unity Catalog for RBAC, PII masking
* Full lineage via metadata and data contracts
* Compliance-ready audit logs for DQ and user access
