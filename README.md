## 📥 Ingestion Design (Batch & Streaming)

**Batch Sources**

* Core Banking DB (Loan Book, Repayment History)
* Credit Bureau CSVs (Risk Scores)
* Salesforce CRM (via REST)

**Streaming Sources**

* Kafka: Application Events, Status Updates
* REST APIs: Mortgage calculators, property lookup

> All ingestion jobs are metadata-driven using YAML/CSV configs and Airflow DAG templates.

---

## 🧱 Data Modeling (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

### 🪵 Bronze Layer

* Schema-on-read via Delta Lake
* Partitioned + raw zone tables
* Initial validations (nulls, dedupe)

### ✨ Silver Layer

* Business logic joins (Loan ↔ Customer ↔ Branch)
* Enrichment (credit score, property valuation)
* Denormalized entity tables for ML pipelines

### 🏅 Gold Layer

* Modular, KPI-driven views and aggregates
* Used by Tableau, APIs, and ML models
* Implemented via Spark SQL + dbt models

---

## 🧮 dbt for Modular SQL Pipelines

**Why dbt?**

* Clean modular SQL
* Lineage and documentation via `dbt docs`
* Integrated with Unity Catalog and GitHub Actions

```bash
dbt run --select gold.application_volume
dbt test --store-failures
dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve
```

---

## 🔗 Graph Data Modeling Layer

GraphFrames are used to model:

* 👤 Customer ↔ 🏦 Branch ↔ 🧾 Application relationships
* 🔗 Social and financial co-relationships between applicants
* 📉 Propagation of defaults and delinquency risk

Use cases:

* Influencer detection
* Churn clusters
* Loan recommendation paths

> Stored in Delta tables with dynamic connected component scoring and centrality measures.

| Regression QA      | Snapshot diffs + data contracts       |

---

## 📦 Containerization & AKS

* Spark jobs as Docker containers
* AKS pods handle streaming ingestion and model serving
* Load-balanced Flask APIs for dashboard/application support
* Helm-based deployment + secrets via AKV
